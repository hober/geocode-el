# geocoder.us API client for Emacs

This is my initial, very rough cut of an Elisp API client for [geocoder.us][]. Depends on Ulf Jasper's [csv.el][]. A simple `make csv.el` should fetch it for you.

This code has one entry point, `geocode`, which takes an address.

[geocoder.us]: http://geocoder.us/
[csv.el]: http://ulf.epplejasper.de/downloads/csv.el
